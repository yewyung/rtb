        "Question": "How does the investment approach to property valuation work?",
        "Answer": "The investment approach assesses a property's market rental rate against the capitalization rate (cap rate), which reflects the property's potential profitability. It starts with calculating the Net Operating Income (NOI) by considering the market rental rate, accounting for potential vacancy rates and deducting property-related costs. Then, the current market value is determined by comparing the property to similar sales. Finally, the cap rate is calculated by dividing the NOI by the market value and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the pros and cons of using the investment method for property valuation?",
        "Answer": "Pros of the investment method include its ability to assess potential rental value, enable comparisons between properties, and offer a detailed financial analysis of an investment. However, it has some drawbacks, such as being a complex process that relies on certain assumptions, uncertainty about whether estimated costs align with real operating costs, and the need for comparison properties for cap rate and rental analysis."

    {
        "Question": "When is the investment method of property valuation a suitable choice?",
        "Answer": "The investment method is typically a suitable choice when you want to assess property value in relation to potential rental returns.

The investment method is particularly beneficial for analyzing investment opportunities for rental purposes."

    {
        "Question": "How can individuals determine the right property valuation approach for their needs?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the two common methods used to determine a property's market value, and how do they differ?",
        "Answer": "The two common methods are the Sales Comparison method and the Cost Approach. The Sales Comparison method estimates a property's value by comparing it to recently sold similar properties based on factors like location, square footage, number of rooms, renovations, and age. The Cost Approach derives a property's value by subtracting depreciation costs from the land and construction costs."
    },

    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is the presence of unpleasant neighbors mentioned as a factor affecting property valuation?",
